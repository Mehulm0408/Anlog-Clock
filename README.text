# Analog Clock ⏰

This is a simple **analog clock** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands that update in real-time.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── index.html   # Main HTML file
├── style.css    # Styles for the clock design
├── script.js    # JavaScript logic to rotate the clock hands
├── clock.png    # Clock face background
```

## 🚀 How It Works
- The **clock face** is created using `clock.png`.
- The **hour, minute, and second hands** are styled with CSS.
- JavaScript (`setInterval`) updates the hands every second based on the system time.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Download all files into the same folder.
2. Open **index.html** in any modern web browser.
3. The clock will run automatically.
